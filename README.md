# Api.DogFood

## Overview

Eating your own API Dog Food.

The main purpose of this demo is to demonstrate how you can consume an external ASP.NET Web API endpoint from both ASP.NET MVC and JavaScript clients.

In particular it covers how to enable session based authentication (or simple man's OAuth) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
